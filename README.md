# Teaching resources for Digital Campus students

I'll fill this as more stuff comes. Under construction. Managing expectations, you know?

## Troubleshooting

* **I cannot edit the notebook at all, and I don't see the same interface**: you may have clicked on the `wikidata.ipynb` file from the GitHub interface, which has led you to a read-only version of the notebook. Instead, click on the `launch binder` blue badge on top of this README.
* **I don't see the notebook after clicking the badge, it says "Starting repository"**: wait a moment, the interface will appear, Binder is building your Python environment and installing stuff.
* **Cells don't execute anymore**: you may have been inactive on the notebook a bit too long and Binder has taken back the resources it gave you. If you wrote code, now is the time to back it up somewhere or __it will be lost__. Then, go back to the original GitHub (this page right here) and click the `launch binder` button again to start a new session.
* **I get a 503 error when I refresh the page**: same as above, but you cannot save your code if you haven't backed it up. Sorry. You can start a new session.
* **I don't like Binder, I want more freedom**: so do I. You can make a Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook install on your machine and clone this repository locally. It's how I made the original notebook before sharing it! I will link to a tutorial at some point.
